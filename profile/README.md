### 🚀 New to Userscripts? Here’s How to Get Started:

To unlock the full potential of these enhancements, you'll typically use a browser extension that manages userscripts.

*   **Easy Installation:** Follow our straightforward **[**Installation Guide**](https://github.com/BBBaden-Moodle-userscripts/userscript-installation-guide/blob/main/README.md)** for a step-by-step walkthrough. (Note: CSS-only installations are handled differently and are also covered).
*   **Get Our Scripts:**
    *   Find our individual userscripts and themes directly on the **[Chrome Web Store](link-to-your-chrome-store-page)** and the **[Firefox Add-ons Page](link-to-your-firefox-store-page)**!
    *   Alternatively, you can use a general User Script Manager browser extension to install scripts from our repository.
